#Overview
This collection of demonstrations is meant to show-off the various features of Pulse and what it is currently capable of doing. For more information on Pulse itself, please visit the [Pulse website][1], or the public github repository. 

#Examples
Examples demonstrate specific functionality in Pulse, like the drag/drop event stack or loading assets using the asset manager. You can access examples using *index.html* inside the *examples* folder and adding the query string *?demo=[demo-path]*. For example, to access the drapdrop example you would use *examples/index.html?demo=event/dragdrop*.

The demo referenced in the query string is a path, so you can add examples and access them using *?demo=path/to/example/jsFile*. You should not add a *.js* extension to the query string.

#Games
Games are slightly more complex demonstrations of what pulse can do. You have to access each game individually inside the *games* folder. For example, to access the megaman demo you would use *games/megaman*. Each game has an index.html file, so you can link to the folder instead of the HTML file.


#Performance Tests
Like games, performance tests can be quite complex and thus each test has its own working directory. You can access *performance* tests the same way as games, just use the performance folder as the base in place of the *games* folder.
